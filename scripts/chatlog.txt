[13:03:57] Armand|X13s (Armand|X13s!~Armand@user/armand): make sure sshd is running
[13:04:07] ssm_ (ssm_!~ssm_@mail.howdoesmycode.work): bushmaster: is sshd running on bladeOS? can your external machine access the listening port with netcat or similar?
[13:04:10] bushmaster (bushmaster!~DaddyGoon@user/bushmaster): hang tight my dude
[13:04:23] bushmaster (bushmaster!~DaddyGoon@user/bushmaster): ssm_, no

[13:06:44] bushmaster (bushmaster!~DaddyGoon@user/bushmaster): yes my dude
[13:07:19] system72 (system72!~system72@user/system72): bushmaster: install openssh then
[13:07:36] system72 (system72!~system72@user/system72): you can start the daemon with systemctl enable --now sshd
[13:08:07] Armand|X13s (Armand|X13s!~Armand@user/armand): Talk about a 3 seconds on Google issue...
[13:08:34] bushmaster (bushmaster!~DaddyGoon@user/bushmaster): there is no package called openssh in blade my dude, there is one called openssh-server and it is already installed and doing fuck all
[13:08:46] blobdog (blobdog!~blobdog@user/blobdog): openssh-server should do the trick
[13:08:53] bushmaster (bushmaster!~DaddyGoon@user/bushmaster): system72, hang tight my dude

[13:09:20] blobdog (blobdog!~blobdog@user/blobdog): it's the "and it came to pass" of surfer lingo
[13:10:13] bushmaster (bushmaster!~DaddyGoon@user/bushmaster): system72, it says Failed to enable unit : Refusing to operate on alias name or linked unit file : sshd.service
[13:10:55] bushmaster (bushmaster!~DaddyGoon@user/bushmaster): blobdog, openssh-server is already installed and doing fuck all
[13:11:15] system72 (system72!~system72@user/system72): bushmaster: specify sshd.service instead
[13:11:31] bushmaster (bushmaster!~DaddyGoon@user/bushmaster): how system72  my dude?
[13:11:57] Armand|X13s (Armand|X13s!~Armand@user/armand): 'sudo systemctl enable --now sshd.service'
[13:12:53] system72 (system72!~system72@user/system72): bushmaster: is it already enabled? whats inside of /etc/systemd/system/
[13:12:55] bushmaster (bushmaster!~DaddyGoon@user/bushmaster): hang tight Armand|X13s
[13:12:58] Armand|X13s (Armand|X13s!~Armand@user/armand): This really is *EASY* Google stuff.

[14:02:24] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): holy moly this brother printer i got this afternoon makes my canon, not a canon.
[14:02:43] mgedmin (mgedmin!~mg@user/mgedmin): can I have a dataclass that forwards one of its fields elsewhere via a property?  I want that field included in the generated __repr__
[14:02:49] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): i click on print test page and this thing just like shoots out a printed test page in like 1s
[14:02:57] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): lol
[14:03:06] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): mefistofeles: as in .field and .someproperty exists?
[14:03:52] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): (where .someproperty returns .field)
[14:04:08] theseb (theseb!~theseb@2606:e2c0:104:a9b1:cbc9:42b4:7c3a:9dbc): gAy_Dragon: an instant debugging service is totally safe no?
[14:04:26] ashafq (ashafq!~ashafq@user/ashafq): irked: I am glad you like your new printer.
[14:04:39] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): theseb: you cannot make an analogy, then when I respond directly to the analogy, reframe my statement outside of the analogy
[14:04:49] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): _regardless_, no, because the information returned could be GPL'd.
[14:04:50] TML (TML!~tml@user/tml): theseb: can we not have that debate here?
[14:04:54] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): and ^.
[14:04:56] ashafq (ashafq!~ashafq@user/ashafq): I keep two printers around just in case of them fails.
[14:05:05] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): mefistofeles: if yes, just @property in the class def should be fine?
[14:05:23] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): i didnt know printers are this crazy fast nowadays
[14:05:27] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): mine's pretty old
[14:05:32] TML (TML!~tml@user/tml): gAy_Dragon: you're targeting mefistofeles but mgedmin asked the question
[14:05:37] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): cant find ink for it :|
[14:05:37] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): ...
[14:05:38] ashafq (ashafq!~ashafq@user/ashafq): maybe someday I will write a printer driver that does RAID-0 of printout
[14:05:39] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): DANGIT
[14:05:46] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): heheheheh cool
[14:05:59] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): sorry mefistofeles, mgedmin, same thing, I always flip the g and e in your nick
[14:06:05] nb-ben (nb-ben!~ben@user/nb-ben): what do you print with it?
[14:06:09] TML (TML!~tml@user/tml): wasn't going to say anything the first time, but you kept going :)
[14:06:09] mefistofeles (mefistofeles!~mefistofe@user/mefistofeles): lol I was confused
[14:06:27] MacGyver (MacGyver!~macgyver@user/macgyver): See this is why you need to be more lazy.
[14:06:39] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): TML: in my defense I didnt spot the colour difference as I just have 12 lines
[14:06:42] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): i usually do more scanning, so i looked for an adf
[14:06:43] MacGyver (MacGyver!~macgyver@user/macgyver): Had you just typed "m<tab>" everything would have been fine, presumably.
[14:06:47] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): Is there a page I can use to look up which kernel version supports which gpus? I'm trying to nail down exactly what version I need for a 9070xt.
[14:06:48] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): MacGyver: No, thats what got into me, I typed me<tab>
[14:06:58] MacGyver (MacGyver!~macgyver@user/macgyver): Exactly. *More* lazy.
[14:06:59] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): i just print documents like for when i sold my house and stuff like that
[14:07:52] MacGyver (MacGyver!~macgyver@user/macgyver): (Unless you run a client that doesn't keep a priority list based on who last spoke, I think irssi is one of those by default)
[14:07:53] nb-ben (nb-ben!~ben@user/nb-ben): yeah I guess RE people still need real paper lol
[14:08:06] mefistofeles (mefistofeles!~mefistofe@user/mefistofeles): gAy_Dragon: don't even use nicknames and you'll never have this problem
[14:08:06] mefistofeles (mefistofeles!~mefistofe@user/mefistofeles): xD
[14:08:13] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): weechat does, I just generally two chars x.x
[14:08:17] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): its all these irritating financial and legal people
[14:08:17] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): mefistofeles: well FINE
[14:08:25] nb-ben (nb-ben!~ben@user/nb-ben): even though people sell companies for hundreds of millions using digital signage :p
[14:08:34] deconfed (deconfed!~UserNick@user/deconfed): э
[14:08:34] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): they always want signatures n stuff lol
[14:08:35] blobdog (blobdog!~blobdog@user/blobdog): phryk: see if it's listed in the Linux Hardware Database https://linux-hardware.org
[14:08:42] blobdog (blobdog!~blobdog@user/blobdog): ...which is loading very slowly
[14:08:53] nb-ben (nb-ben!~ben@user/nb-ben): you can sign with your phone these days
[14:08:56] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): yeah i dunno when south africa will be on that level
[14:09:23] xless1 (xless1!~caesari02@user/xless1): the ink cost a fortune, like $70000 for my epson
[14:09:39] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): these days a printer is its ink cost
[14:09:44] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): its ridiculous
[14:09:47] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): yes^^
[14:09:49] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): and they take up a lot of desk space
[14:10:04] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): but sounds very exactly like what i'm looking for (if it displays kernel versions)
[14:10:52] the_watcher (the_watcher!uid731096@user/the-watcher:50416): phryk: 6.13.5 and up
[14:11:12] nb-ben (nb-ben!~ben@user/nb-ben): and if you forget your admin password, you need their customer service to reset it
[14:11:30] the_watcher (the_watcher!uid731096@user/the-watcher:50416): Technically 6.12 but the performance was crappy til 6.13.5
[14:11:35] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): the_watcher: is the site loading faster for you or where'd you get that information?
[14:11:46] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): i nearly got that huge epson projector, until i realised i'll need to paint or get a thing for it to project onto
[14:11:59] theseb (theseb!~theseb@2606:e2c0:104:a9b1:cbc9:42b4:7c3a:9dbc): gAy_Dragon: you make a valid point
[14:12:01] nb-ben (nb-ben!~ben@user/nb-ben): just to remind you, you're just paying for the privilege of having their hardware in your house, not to actually own it
[14:12:09] the_watcher (the_watcher!uid731096@user/the-watcher:50416): Google
[14:12:27] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): obviously you dont own it man, that's how intellectual property works
[14:12:35] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): :-)
[14:12:42] the_watcher (the_watcher!uid731096@user/the-watcher:50416): the_watcher: also says it https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-radeon-rx9070-linux
[14:12:55] the_watcher (the_watcher!uid731096@user/the-watcher:50416): Woops I meant phryk
[14:13:02] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): i feel like a teenager, let me print some pornoz
[14:13:20] smoll (smoll!~smoll@user/smoll): wayland or xorg
[14:13:24] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): put some faces on etc. with photoshop. etc.
[14:13:43] smoll (smoll!~smoll@user/smoll): whats even the difference
[14:13:58] the_watcher (the_watcher!uid731096@user/the-watcher:50416): Lots of things
[14:14:24] smoll (smoll!~smoll@user/smoll): like what
[14:14:27] xx (xx!~xx@user/xx): both can display a cat, not much difference aside from that
[14:14:38] smoll (smoll!~smoll@user/smoll): exactly
[14:14:45] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): the_watcher: ah thanks, that mirrors what i read on some site (i think it was thereg or phoronix) about symbols for those cards appearing in the code, but without a definite statement whether that was just in preparation or meant actual support.
[14:14:46] kariosfox (kariosfox!~karios@095160156110.dynamic-2-waw-k-4-0-0.vectranet.pl): i guess one is newer by several decades
[14:15:01] xx (xx!~xx@user/xx): kariosfox: doesn't matter, it's an old cat picture
[14:15:17] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): wayland should have a lot less roundtrips for its rendering.
[14:15:56] SnoopJ (SnoopJ!~snoopj@user/snoopj): TML, square box with a button that says fork(2) on it? :)
[14:15:58] smoll (smoll!~smoll@user/smoll): i wish desktop enviornments were just framebuffer
[14:16:06] the_watcher (the_watcher!uid731096@user/the-watcher:50416): https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/HljIxAOd
[14:16:07] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): but with a gpu from the last 10-15 years, i doubt it makes much of a felt difference. i'm still on xorg because i want to write my own wayland compositor (i'm crazy, wouldn't recommend that approach).
[14:16:30] the_watcher (the_watcher!uid731096@user/the-watcher:50416): Think of Xorg as an old phone system with a switchboard operator, and Wayland as a modern smartphone with a streamlined network where phones connect more directly. Wayland is the future, but some older applications might have compatibility issues because it’s a big change from Xorg.
[14:18:08] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): i wonder whether using wayland would actually translate to better gaming performance. guess i'll get to try as i'll have to migrate my desktop from freebsd to linux to get support for my new gpu before 2027^^;
[14:18:13] TML (TML!~tml@user/tml): SnoopJ: it comes into existence, its life is intended to be brief and serve a very specific purpose, then it goes away; every moment the process remains running is painful to it :)
[14:18:56] the_watcher (the_watcher!uid731096@user/the-watcher:50416): Heh. Ya gaming on freebsd isn't much of a priority
[14:19:19] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): not much of a possibility either, tho i haven't given proton a try yet and apparently there's a port…
[14:19:22] password (password!~password8@user/password2): :O
[14:19:41] mlu (mlu!~mlu@about/linux/staff/mlu): I really liked FreeBSD, but Linux has simply gotten way improved over the past couple decades
[14:19:48] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): currently, i just have a parallel win10 install i use for gaming only, but if i can get more games over to *nix, that'd be great.
[14:20:20] Lore (Lore!~Lore@user/Lore): smoll, it's in the very FAQ of Wayland which is quite cheerful.
[14:20:48] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): mlu: i honestly think freebsd has *much* better engineering than pretty much any linux distro i ever came across. my only gripe is the driver support, but "*nix gamedev" is hardly the target audience of the OS^^;
[14:20:51] Lore (Lore!~Lore@user/Lore): smoll, https://wayland.freedesktop.org/faq.html#heading_toc_j_2
[14:21:05] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): im kidding :)
[14:21:15] mlu (mlu!~mlu@about/linux/staff/mlu): phryk: totally agreed there -- the comprehensive system design is key
[14:21:34] djph (djph!~dpurgert@24.160.186.189): (no you're not)
[14:21:37] mlu (mlu!~mlu@about/linux/staff/mlu): and yet, driver support is so much of what makes the system work well, in practice
[14:21:39] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): shhht
[14:21:42] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): mlu: yeah, the entire "one place to make it all" just makes for way better integration, that's kind of *the* inherent bsd advantage.
[14:22:07] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): especially if its a python proc
[14:22:09] tokaparas (tokaparas!tokaparas@user/tokaparas): phryk: you're lucky to test the system now, before the choice is taken away from you
[14:22:19] djph (djph!~dpurgert@24.160.186.189): wait, which POS not-your-printer did you buy?
[14:22:19] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): that said, i'm absolutely looking forward to trying void linux.
[14:22:24] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): tokaparas: what do you mean?
[14:22:38] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): i got a brother dcp t730dw
[14:22:39] tokaparas (tokaparas!tokaparas@user/tokaparas): phryk: distros/DEs are killing xorg
[14:22:41] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): that's what it says
[14:23:00] djph (djph!~dpurgert@24.160.186.189): hm, inkjet?
[14:23:06] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): eh, can't really fault them for that. xorg has already been hanging on for way longer than i anticipated.
[14:23:13] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): yeh
[14:23:19] tokaparas (tokaparas!tokaparas@user/tokaparas): phryk: works fine today
[14:23:44] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): tokaparas: yeah, i'm still running xorg with awesomewm; but like i said, only because i haven't gotten around to writing my own wayland compositor. :P
[14:24:28] HeadphoneJack (HeadphoneJack!~kfrench@user/kfrench): To be fair, X11's design has survived many unanticipated major features over the decades.  It's hard to poo poo on it.
[14:24:35] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): i'll probably try out sway when i set up void tho.
[14:24:37] japon (japon!~japon@97.144-121-193.fia-dyn.isp.proximus.be): irked: i got one of those epson projectors. i have no issue projecting on a my wall that's cream color that has a "crepi" texture on it.
[14:25:02] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): japon you're serious?
[14:25:04] japon (japon!~japon@97.144-121-193.fia-dyn.isp.proximus.be): unless your walls are super dark, i don't think you need to worry about that
[14:25:13] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): cool!
[14:25:39] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): HeadphoneJack: yea, not trying to do that. back in the day especially it was way more versatile than what for example windows had; but it's just more of a mainframe-era kind of system and at some point the technical debt from its heritage just becomes too much to keep mainstream support.
[14:26:12] tokaparas (tokaparas!tokaparas@user/tokaparas): becomes too much means the plan is to kill it
[14:26:43] msfVenom (msfVenom!~h4x0r@about/hackers/h4x0r): omg
[14:27:15] uwharrie (uwharrie!~uwharrie@user/uwharrie): meanwhile some of the things X11 was able to easily do are still yet to be solved in a consistent or stable way
[14:27:29] deconfed (deconfed!~UserNick@user/deconfed): ol
[14:27:30] Lore (Lore!~Lore@user/Lore): > Also, the entire core rendering API that lets you draw stippled lines, polygons, wide arcs and many more state-of-the-1980s style graphics primitives.
[14:27:37] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): not really, phased out support by other projects is something else; you also have to acknowledge that keeping support eats a lot of time distros and DEs could spend on areas that are more pressing than keeping support for something that was intended for a very different type of environment.
[14:27:38] Lore (Lore!~Lore@user/Lore): < https://wayland.freedesktop.org/faq.html
[14:28:11] japon (japon!~japon@97.144-121-193.fia-dyn.isp.proximus.be): also, nothing glossy. tried once on my kitchen wall where there a slight gloss - the reflection was painfully bright
[14:28:22] Lore (Lore!~Lore@user/Lore): > But we can't ever get rid of the core rendering API and much other complexity that is rarely used in a modern desktop.
[14:28:22] tokaparas (tokaparas!tokaparas@user/tokaparas): very different meaning the GUI ?
[14:28:25] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): i ordered a tv though
[14:28:36] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): i fully expect there to be niche distros that continue to support xorg till at least 2050 tbh
[14:28:57] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): tokaparas: no, xorg was literally developed for a networked mainframe/terminal environment.
[14:29:14] msfVenom (msfVenom!~h4x0r@about/hackers/h4x0r): i was waiting for that :)
[14:29:25] msfVenom (msfVenom!~h4x0r@about/hackers/h4x0r): hows the regex going?
[14:29:31] msfVenom (msfVenom!~h4x0r@about/hackers/h4x0r): <-- regex junkie
[14:29:33] tokaparas (tokaparas!tokaparas@user/tokaparas): phryk: so? it's also used locally. and there's xpra
[14:29:36] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): much of that was torn out in the last 20-odd years, but the overall architecture still reflects it. it just doesn't fit the modern use-case of everything being rendered locally well.
[14:29:51] mgedmin (mgedmin!~mg@user/mgedmin): no, I want a @dataclass class DebugFlags: timings: bool; @property def timings(self): return elsewhere.timings; @timings.setter def timings(self, value): elsewhere.timings = value
[14:30:03] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): yeah, that it *can* do it doesn't mean it can do it *well*.
[14:30:09] tokaparas (tokaparas!tokaparas@user/tokaparas): it does it well
[14:30:19] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): debatable at best.
[14:30:21] tokaparas (tokaparas!tokaparas@user/tokaparas): you should try it one day
[14:30:39] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): mate, are you daft? how many times do i have to tell you that i'm actually running xorg *right now*?
[14:31:01] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): mefistofeles: you want this to set elsewhere.* when constructed with a value?
[14:31:08] tokaparas (tokaparas!tokaparas@user/tokaparas): why do you hate it then?
[14:31:30] irked (irked!~irked@user/irked): its a bloodbath at the shopping malls here
[14:31:33] mgedmin (mgedmin!~mg@user/mgedmin): yes, this is a singleton that needs to forward to a module global elsewhere for reasons (avoiding a dependency cycle)
[14:31:35] phryk (phryk!~totallyno@user/phryk): aight, i'll be ignoring you now as you evidently have no interest in a good-faith discussion.
[14:31:54] mgedmin (mgedmin!~mg@user/mgedmin): technically I don't need this flag in __init__
[14:32:05] mgedmin (mgedmin!~mg@user/mgedmin): perhaps it's easiest to lose the default __repr__ and make one myself
[14:32:15] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): make the classvar an initvar, accept it there, then set self.* with it there, which should forward correctly to the setter
[14:32:37] gAy_Dragon (gAy_Dragon!A_D@libera/staff/dragon): but yeah, just, kill the default repr, or even do some magic to replace it and save a copy at construct time
[14:32:51] MinceR (MinceR!mincer@user/lightbringer): "aeiou"

[14:32:54] Lore (Lore!~Lore@user/Lore): phryk, please don't worry, it's just that some people don't care about history, and want someone's effort and work burn, for literally unknown reason, regardless how diverse the infinite the world is out there with unique environments and tasks/issues. Or they are just not serious at all.

[07:54:45] fgarcia (fgarcia!~lei@user/fgarcia): oh, the computer i am running debian, there was something i didn't like with plasma. something was set up for PIM and it shows up every time i would log in. i'm not sure if it could be the kde database something so i will try switching to xfce for that one
[07:55:48] fgarcia (fgarcia!~lei@user/fgarcia): but other than that kde has been alright. the usage when starting up was less than 800MB. i might have to see when i reboot again today as i could have opened something
[07:57:06] fgarcia (fgarcia!~lei@user/fgarcia): i will try later this week
[07:57:16] kzt (kzt!administra@about/hackers/kzt): i use xfce
[07:58:02] fgarcia (fgarcia!~lei@user/fgarcia): there was a recentish thing that came out. xfce has good marks across the board but it might be old, i don't see plasma taking up gigabytes like what was reported

[07:59:52] fgarcia (fgarcia!~lei@user/fgarcia): i have been loving xfce on my installs. i never got to experience the Common desktop environment and i think this is close. every system i have tried packages xfce
[08:00:15] kzt (kzt!administra@about/hackers/kzt): xfce and in antix icewm
[08:01:19] kzt (kzt!administra@about/hackers/kzt): brb
[08:01:44] fgarcia (fgarcia!~lei@user/fgarcia): one of my computers i messed with x, so i will get to try and see if 'xinit xfce' works. though xfce is my default so i could probably still keep doing 'startx'
